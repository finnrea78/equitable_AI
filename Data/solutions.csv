Solution,Explanation,Time-Cost,Positive effect,Negative effect,Use-Case for which this solution is particularly problematic 
Data subsampling ,Train the model using less data from the majority class. Example: use only 10% of data from the majority class (e.g. White people’s data),Low,Model not skewed towards majority classes,Overall model performance will be lower; model may no longer predicted accurately for the groups which were subsampled,If the Use-case says this is considered to be a relatively low volume of data & model’s overall performance will affect net lives  
Weighting under-represented classes more when training model,Data from these groups will update the model’s decision making significantly. Give different weights to different groups to ensure equitability. ,Low,Model not skewed towards majority classes,Overall model performance will be lower,If the Use-case says model’s overall performance will save lives and/or the dataset has been used in other pipelines and has been concluded there is a lot of bad/missing/data without signal.
Adding small amount of  randomization to model’s decision making ,Makes model less prone to favouring one class over another in its predictions/accuracy of its predictions.,Low,Model performs equitably/better for under-represented social groups,Overall model performance will be lower,If the Use-case says model’s overall performance will save lives and/or the dataset has been used in other pipelines and has been concluded there is a lot of bad/missing/data without signal. If Use-case says interpretability of model is important so it can be adopted by other group (reason: model perturbations may lead to lack of interpretabiltiy)
Collect data to complement existing training data,Get training data to enrich the existing training dataset and compensate for imbalances ,High,Model performs better equitably/better for social groups,"If training data wasn’t collected from a similar time-frame and source as the original, it may add noise to the model",If the Use-case says volume of data is relatively high. OR If the Use-case mentions that the model needs to be rolled out ASAP to save lives.
Optimize for fairer  metric across demographics,"Instead of training a model to optimize for overall accuracy, you could optimize for a score that factors in each subgroup. In other words, model predicts accurately for each demographic.",Medium,Model performs better equitably/better for social groups,Overall model performance will be lower; model may overfit ,If the Use-case says this is a considered to be a relatively low volume of data (overfitting risk) & model’s overall performance will affect net lives (is it better to save 1000 lives even if they are one race or 500 lives of different races)
Synthetic Data generation (upsampling),Use the training data for minority classes to train a synthetic data generation model which can generate more data for those classes.,Medium,Model performs better equitably/better for social groups,May upsample unwanted bias or noise for under-represented groups. May reduce model’s overall performance,If the Use-case says this is a considered to be a relatively low volume of data (overfitting risk) & model’s overall performance will affect net lives
